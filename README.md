# StreamKit
Guides and Tools for demoparty streaming setups. Based around OBS

## Setup

- Clone the repo (or download and extract the zip) to a directory of your choice.
- Run *setup.cmd*. This will install OBS and additional Plugins in a newly created subdirectory *OBS_APP* including all the config files (settings, profiles and scenes). In addition, it will copy the contents of the *assets* dir to *C:\Users\Public\Documents\OBS_Assets*, so that the assets used in the scene are available regardless of the installation path (OBS can't handle relative paths in source configs...)
